									<h3 class="major">Intro</h3>
									<p>Hi, my name is Girish Tiwari and I am currently an Autonomy Simulation Intern at Brunswick Corporation and a Computer Engineering student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,
										and will be graduating this December! I am originally from Pune, Maharashtra, India but mostly grew up in Falmouth, Maine in the U.S. 
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Technical and extracurricular</h3>
									<p>On the technical side, I have experience in a wide array of projects, many of which you can feel free to explore through this portfolio site and my resume, in which I reveal some more
										about what I'm currently doing. My strengths now lie where my weaknesses used to. I have newfound organizational, teamwork, communication and design skills and knowledge. I've had technical
										skills to execute projects before, but my potential to focus this ability and work efficiently in a group setting has grown significantly throughout the past few years. With hardware and
										software design, I have the strong foundations that enable me to learn any technology I need to.
									</p>

									<p>
									Outside work and study, I enjoy many different activities, many of them outdoors. I like boxing, lifting, cooking, skiing, biking, hiking, running, gaming (video games, group games, chess, etc.), skating,
									and listening to/playing music. In the past I've also recorded and edited videos for entertainment. Overall, I really like staying active, playing games and spending quality time with my friends
									and family. I'm also fascinated by astronomy and physics as well as chemistry and of course, computers/electronics, so I love to learn more about these interesting scientific/engineering topics as well.
									</p>
									
									<h3 class="major">My ambitions</h3>

									<p>I am going to change the world. I want to make this planet a better environment for every living being on it. I know my ambitions are far reaching, but I wouldn't strive for something
										I don't believe I can do. I don't want to just limit these changes to those that will occur as a result of technology I create, but rather I wish to leverage all of my skills and
										everything I've learned to drive a movement.
									</p>

									<p>
									I hope you've enjoyed visiting my page and learning a bit more about me. Please feel free to contact me about any opportunities you may know about or if you just have any questions/want to learn more. Also, 
									I strive to be open minded and I welcome constructive criticism as I am always looking to improve. If you have any suggestions for me, don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again!
									</p>
